===========================================
``maskrcnn_utils`` is a repackage version of some utility functions implemented in maskrcnn-benchmark(FAIR). All the functions are written in CPLUS to get a better performance. We do some packaging work in order to easy reuse them in other circumstances.

Functions include:
- nms

Class:
- ROIAlign
- ROIPool
