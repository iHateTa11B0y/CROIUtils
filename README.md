# CROIUtils
This Repo contains C source code and setup code for package **maskrcnn_utils** package which can installed by `pip`

# Notice
The C source code comes from [**maskrcnn-benckmark (FAIR)**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/tree/master/maskrcnn_benchmark/csrc).
We add some interface that make it easy to reuse in other circumstances.
